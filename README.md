Fibonacci Sequence Numbers

I've made programs that displays Fibonacci Sequence Numbers
in diffrent languages.

# Currently writen in these programming languages:
Shell/Bash
Python3
C#

# How to run each program
## Note that I provided info only the ways I tested it out 

Fibonacci.sh written in bash can be run by typing "./Fibonacci.sh" in your terminal once you have located the directory that contains the file.

Fibonacci.py written in python3. If you open it in IDLE just press F5 to run it.

Fibonacci_sequence_in_C# open the directory trough terminal and type "dotnet run Fibonacci"
